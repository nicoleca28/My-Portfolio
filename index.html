		<h3>Nicole</h3>
		<p>My name is Nicole, and I am 15 years old. I’m an incoming 10th grader at Bard High School Early College in Queens. Spanish was my first language, Japanese my second and, English my third. After that, I moved onto studying French and Chinese. I really like working with numbers because of how challenging it gets sometimes and also because literature tends to be a subject a somewhat fall back in. I’ve been told I’m very stubborn and also a “workaholic” as I always put work in front of everything else; however, I do always love to be with my friends whenever I can.</p>
